Easily Turn Your Automated Explanation into a Predictive Model


## Abstract

The Automated Explanation in SAS® Visual Analytics is a powerful and easy way to start your journey into building predictive models. We'll start by creating an Automated Explanation to analyze our data and pick up on key drivers that appear. We will then easily move into building a predictive model using SAS® Visual Statistics. Data Scientists and Business Analyst will see how easy it is to take that next leap in their data analysis. Code will not be harmed, examined, nor executed during this workshop.
